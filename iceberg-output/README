All iceberg output files are stored in Python Pickles, grouped by seasonal
output and iceberg size class. Files can be opened as follows (in Python):

-------

import pickle as pkl

fili = open('seasonal-djf-small.pkl','rb')
data = pickle.load(fili)

x = data[0]         # longitude grid
y = data[1]         # latitude grid
icebergs = data[2]  # number of icebergs that visited the cell (in season)

--------


Data can then be plotted and manipulated. To view data for the full simulation
(i.e. as seen in Figures 1, 2, 3), simply load all four seasons and sum the
fields.
